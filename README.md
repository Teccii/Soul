# Soul
A small mod for Balatro that adds Legendary jokers to the shop pool. Legendary Jokers have a weight of 0.001, a third of the weight of the Soul card found in Booster Packs.

## Installation
Soul requires the [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) to be installed in order to be loaded successfully by Balatro.

After installing Lovely and Steamodded:
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Teccii/Soul/releases).
2. Extract the .zip file into your mods folder at `%AppData%/Balatro/Mods`.

This completes the installation process.
